# register emoji domains
EMOJI DOMAINS ARE 100% COMPATIBLE WITH ALL BROWSERS.  
You didn't know this worked, did you?  
## install
clone the repo and change `emojis` under `index.js` to have whatever you want to look for.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

Behind the scenes, all domains are ASCII, even if you see the domain name displayed as an emoji.

The actual mechanics aren't that important, but the key thing to know is that the browser uses a strategy called "punycoding" to convert "❤❤❤" to "xn--qeiaa" behind the scenes.

Most browsers keep this process hidden... but even when it's not, your emoji domain will work.

### CAN I MIX ASCII AND EMOJI?

It's all emoji or nothing!

... I'm not sure why, but I suspect it's to avoid domain spoofing.

### EMOJI SEARCH RESULTS?

Emoji domains are fully Google compatible. 

IS THIS COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER GODADDY SERVICES?

Yes. We eat our own dog food.

Everything on ❤❤❤.ws is set up through GoDaddy: the domain, SSL, email forwarding, etc... 

### WHY AREN'T THERE MORE EMOJI DOMAINS?

There will be.

The language of emojis is universal, understood all over the world.

As mobile first web usage skyrockets, the logic of emoji domain names is inescapable.

Until now, emoji domain names been difficult to register. One has to have a reasonably sophisticated knowledge of punycode and whatnot to even look to see whether domains are available. From there, the setup is a bit of a pain.

It's not like you can go to the GoDaddy homepage on a mobile phone and start entering emojis.

❤❤❤.ws solves that problem.
